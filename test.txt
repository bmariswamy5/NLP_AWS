Data science has so far mainly been used for positive outcomes for businesses and society,for example in risk management, to predict terrorist attacks or detect tax fraud,or in a business setting to increase profitability and revenues or reduce costs.
Citizens have enjoyed better more efficient services thanks to data science.
However, just as with any technology, data science has also come with some negative consequences: an increase of privacy invasion,
data-driven discrimination against sensitive groups, and data-driven decision-making without explanations.
